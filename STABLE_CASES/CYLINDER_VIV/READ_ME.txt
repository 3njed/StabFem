-Any results are available in Github, for memory reasons. But normally, they can be created by running the codes, by section. If you need some results or you don't understand something, read the Documentation(Cylinder_VIV is not done yet, sorry) or contact my at:
diogogdsabi@gmail.com
diogo.ferreirasabino@imft.fr

-DNS results for the forced-case are stocked directly in IMFT shared folders, go see David Lo Jacono(and read the read me, at ./NL/).

-I lost the folder Literrature_data, I don't know where it is... but it's not that important.
