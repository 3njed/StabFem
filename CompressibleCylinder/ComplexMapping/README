This code is a complex mapping version that is able to compute the baseflow at a given subsonic Ma number and Re.
It performs linear stability of the direct and adjoint modes. 
It computes the sensitivity to Mach variations.
It determines the bifurcation threshold with Re number as parameter for a given Ma. 
It performs a WNL analysis and this is used to set the guess for Self-Consistent analysis.
